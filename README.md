  ### App Functionality

  Upon visiting the website for the first time, the user is presented with the homepage, which includes the option to log in, sign up, and a brief overview of Hoodlinked. If a user has previously created an account, they may sign in. Otherwise, a new account can be made using the forms.

  Creating an account/signing in will redirect the user to their dashboard where a user can see their Groups and Items.
